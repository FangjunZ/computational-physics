Mercuryâ€™s precession &amp; double pendulum simulation
This Jupyter notebook based project can give one experience in computational physics solving numerically for the dynamics of the systems.
Four formulas describing the Keplerian orbit of a test particle around the Sun will be needed: 
$$r(\theta) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+ecos(\theta-\theta_{E}} $$
